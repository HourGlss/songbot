## TO INSTALL
pip install pipenv

pipenv install twitchio

pipenv install pywin32

Make a .env file inside same folder as bot.py

include this exactly

TMI_TOKEN=oauth:

CLIENT_ID=

BOT_NICK=

BOT_PREFIX=!

CHANNEL=

Then fill in that info with this stuff:

Make an account on Twitch (for your bot) or use the one you stream with. Make it something cool like RealStreamer69 ðŸ˜Ž

Request an oauth code (https://twitchapps.com/tmi/). You'll need to login and give the app permissions to generate it for you.

Register your app with Twitch dev(https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create) and request a client-id (so you can interface with Twitch's API)
